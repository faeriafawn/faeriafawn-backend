      <h2>About Me 🩷</h2><img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="me"  style="max-width:200px; height:auto;">
      <p>
       I'm Ria! The founder and creative force behind faeriafawn, a cottagecore & nature themed art brand. I'm a British artist born in Hampshire, southern England in 2001. I'm neurodivergent and a big introvert that loves the countryside cozy life and everything about it! 
      </p>
      <h2>How did faeriafawn come to life?</h2>
      <p>
        Faeriafawn, starting in 2025, is my own business with whom I am the sole creator. It grew from my love of blending gentle fantasy with everyday joy. The name combines faerie ( fairytale magic ), Ria ( my preferred nickname ), and fawn ( symbolizing Innocence, gentleness and nature ). Together, they reflect the heart of my work: whimsical, comforting and heartfelt. It's about building a little world of comfort and wonder that people can step into, through prints, stickers, or little goods that contain the whimsy and essence of nature. 
      </p>
      <h2>What inspired me to start creating art?</h2>
      <p>I've always been drawn to soft, whimsical worlds and animals my whole life. I have always been inspired by storybooks,  fairytales and cute everything. My interests influence a lot of my life , including my art that is inspired a lot by Disney and classic children's storybook illustrations, such as; peter rabbit, winnie the pooh, Alice in wonderland and Bambi, just to name a few. So I have been creating art for most of my life as a hobbyist. I'm also a huge fan of animation in general, my all time favourite show is My Little Pony, which I have always loved my whole life, and played a big role in inspiring me to create my own business with my own characters! Just like Lauren Faust (the creator of My Little Pony: Friendship is magic).</p>
